Description:This generative artwork was created in Processing through a system based on conditional loops and randomized coordinate generation. The code draws ten radial connections from a fixed central point toward randomly defined positions within a bounded range. Each connection consists of a solid circle and a line linking back to the core, exploring the interplay between algorithmic control and computational randomness. The use of deep blue highlights the concept of connectivity and energy across the generated nodes.
