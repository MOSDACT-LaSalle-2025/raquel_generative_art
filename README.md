Work: Radial Connections
Artist: Raquel Benavides
Location and date: Barcelona, 07/31/2025
Technique: Code in Processing, using conditional loops and controlled randomness.

Concept
Explores the connection between order and chaos: a fixed central point links to 10 randomly generated nodes, symbolizing networks (neural, social, digital). The deep blue color (#3e54c1) evokes energy, technology, and cohesion.

Form
600×600 px canvas, white background.
10 blue circles (50 px) connected by lines to the center (300,300).
Each execution produces a unique distribution due to the use of random().

Technique
Uses Processing’s setup() and draw() functions.
Loop controlled by a counter (i < 10).
Random positions within a centered range: random(-250,250)+300.
Combines algorithm (control) and randomness (autonomy) → generative art.

Conclusion
A minimalist piece showing how simple rules + randomness create complex structures. Embodies the core of generative art: the process, not just the result.



An algorithmic system that draws random radial connections, exploring the balance between control and chaos.
